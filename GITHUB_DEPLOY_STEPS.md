# Deploy Your Replit Project to Vercel via GitHub

Since you're logged into Vercel but your project is in Replit, here's the easiest way to deploy:

## Step 1: Connect Replit to GitHub

**In your Replit workspace:**

1. Click the version control icon (looks like a branch) on the left sidebar
2. Click "Create a Git repository" 
3. Choose "Initialize Git repo and push to GitHub"
4. Follow the prompts to connect to your GitHub account
5. Your project will be pushed to GitHub automatically

## Step 2: Deploy from Vercel Dashboard

**In your web browser:**

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Click "Import Git Repository" 
4. Find your newly created repository (should be called something like "ulimi" or "ulimi-web")
5. Click "Import"
6. Click "Deploy"

That's it! Vercel will automatically:
- Use the build configuration I set up
- Build your app with the fixed ESM settings
- Deploy it to a live URL

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables

After deployment:
1. In your Vercel dashboard, click on your project
2. Go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add your database URL and any API keys

## Why This Works Better

- Your project files are in Replit (not on your Mac)
- GitHub connects Replit to Vercel
- Vercel uses the deployment configuration I already set up
- No permission errors or file path issues

## Alternative: Export and Deploy Locally

If you prefer to deploy from your Mac:
1. In Replit, click the three dots menu → "Download as zip"
2. Extract to a folder on your Mac
3. Open terminal and navigate to that folder
4. Run `vercel --prod --yes` from there

The key point: deploy from where your project files actually are!
